				<h2>Life is full of confusing</h2>
				<p>Life is full of confusing and disordering Particular time,a particular location,Do the arranged thing of ten million time in the brain,Step by step ,the life is hard to avoid delicacy and stiffness No enthusiasm forever,No unexpected happening of surprising and pleasing So,only silently ask myself in mind Next happiness,when will come?</p>

			<section id="section_2" class="content">
				<div class="arrow"></div>
				<h2>Dark light</h2>
				<p>Dark light,just light each other.The responsibility that you and my shoulders take together,the such as one dust covers up. Afraid only afraid the light is suddenly put out in theendless dark night and Countless loneliness.</p>

			<section id="section_3" class="content">
				<div class="arrow"></div>
				<h2>Always insisting</h2>
				<p>Always insisting.Use iron scoop is too cold; Use porcelain scoop is too weak; A wood scoop,engraved veins safely,engraved sky’s wasteland and glebe’s old.Just as happiness born in the years,not insolent,the every act and move blooms quietly.</p>

				<h2>A helping hand</h2>
				<p>Remember, if you ever need a helping hand, you'll find them at the end of each of your arms. As you grow older, you will discover that you have two hands, one for helping yourself, the other for helping others.</p>

				<h2>Sunset west</h2>
				<p>Then the wandering soul wild crane stands still the memory river Listen to whistle play tightly ring slowly,Water rises a ship to go medium long things of the past.Wait for a ship’s person Wait for one and other,But hesitate always should ascend which ship Missed Had to consign the hope to next time,Finally what to wait for until has no boats and ships to come and go,Sunset west.</p>
